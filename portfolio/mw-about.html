		<h1>Who is Mentally_Wrong?</h1>
		<img id="hero" src="images/MW_Images/Millett_Idol.jpg" alt="MW_Idol">
		<p>Hi, I'm Bryan Millett, a gaming nerd with a deep love for music, film, and art. Design plays a significant role in my life, allowing me to learn about the world and create art that reflects my understanding of it. Mentally_Wrong began as a username on platforms like Instagram, Twitter/X, Steam, PlayStation, and YouTube. It originally meant someone isn't in their right mind, but now it's my side project brand, giving me creative liberty to make content that truly satisfies me.
		<br>
		<br>
		The idea for Mentally_Wrong as a brand, not just a username, came from a need to scratch a creative itch that traditional graphic design jobs couldn't satisfy. Most graphic design roles are template-based, prepress jobs in disguise, or bundled with other duties. While these roles have value, they don't fulfill my deeper need to create and be creative. That's why Mentally_Wrong is now a major part of my life, offering a space for genuine creation and a more human approach to content creation.
		<br>
		<h2 class="content-break">What's the Difference?</h2>
		<br>
		Mentally_Wrong is my personal venture, while BMillett Media is my professional one. It's the difference between Business-to-Business (B2B) and Business-to-Consumer (B2C) marketing. BMillett Media caters to companies looking to hire me, whereas Mentally_Wrong works directly with individuals who prefer a personal touch over automated responses. Think of it as an old-school, retro approach where genuine creation attracts genuine people seeking genuine goods.
		<br>
		<br>
		Currently, I'm growing Mentally_Wrong through Twitch and YouTube by creating meaningful content and streaming. My content revolves around pop culture, including my questions, analysis, and relationship with it. Although I have a personal interest in horror and various pop culture aspects, my aim is to be straightforward and authentic across all walks of life. At Mentally_Wrong, we value honesty and clarity over corporate jargon.
		<br>
		<br>
		Mentally_Wrong is my happy little domain where rejects reign supreme and where traditional corporate design methods are not welcome. It's a place for genuine human connection through the content we create for ourselves and for those who need talented creatives. Mentally_Wrong is the rejects' stand against corporate ideology where genuinely talented individuals can design for people who want to speak with humans, not robots, and appreciate straightforward communication.

		<h2>Donations and Tips</h2>
		<p>Establishing a brand of rejects is not easy nor cheap. Currently, Mentally_Wrong is a one-man-show and that one-man can use all the help he can get. Between looking for the next step in my main career, knocking doors for political non-profits to keep up with the bills, classes for a second degree in Software Development, one can understand why Mentally_Wrong is a side project and not the next big step in my career. Anything and everything helps to keep the lights on and the dream alive.

		A Zazzle store is ready if you would rather purchase something from me instead of leaving a tip or donation; Mentally_Wrong designed products is in the works. Currently available is No Soliciting lawn signs designed to be fun and to keep unwanted solicitors from knocking on your door. If you are a fan of my YouTube content, I have created deskmats inspired by the backgrounds of my current videos. I take pride in my video content and a great deal of attention is given to the animated backgrounds in each of my videos.More to come in the near future.
