			<p>When it comes to video, there are many different things I consider. How it is going to be used and how it is meant to be seen. This example is for the Hirschi Masonry website. I used the provided footage, cleaned it up, and set up the video to showcase the best of the services provided by Hirschi Masonry.</p>

			<p>To make table top games seem more interesting, a stop motion short was pitched to show the excitement in table top games by recontextualizing a game of chess. By expanding the scope to include novelty dice and playing cards, the short was able to allow for a more exciting stop-animated short for viewing.</p>
			<h3>Futureland: Animated Proof of Concept Music Video</h3>

			<p>Recently, I have been finding myself listening to the European music genre appropriately called Eurobeat. Eurobeat is an Italian based genre of music that has made significant influence in Japanese music markets. This influence was so promenade it would play a critical role in the anime Initial D in the sound direction through the use of licensing songs from various Eurobeat artists like Mega NRG Man, Dave Rogers and Leslie Parrish. From there the show and the genre grew together in themes as the genre employed ideas and concepts from Initial D; mainly driving, racing, and high speeds. This genre, unfortunately, has no current mainstay in western music labels and distribution. The goal of the project is to create a short proof of concept music video to show the marketing power this 80s European music genre in a similar way Michael Jackson and Devo did in the inception of MTV. Graphically, the project will follow the technical ideas of Initial D of combining 3D and 2D animated assets to create a single cohesive scene. The song in question for this project is entitled FUTURELAND by Ace. I mainly focused on using Autodesk Maya and the Adobe Creative Cloud software services.</p>
