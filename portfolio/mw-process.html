	<h1>How do I do it?</h1>

		<h2>Where do I get started?</h2>
		<!--Shot of my sketchbook & laptop-->
		<img>
		<p>Getting started on a project is rather easy, its making progress from the inital idea that makes things interesting. I begin from looking over what media I encountered and ask questions about it. "How does this game keep the player engaged from the begining?" "How did this media impact me to in my life?" "Is there something deeper here that I can find out?" The content that is produced is editorial and reflective about the media that surrounds us. Design and art are the central focus of the inital step.
		<br>
		<br>
		From there the real test begins. I draft the inital version of the video script or test the waters of the subject. If it is a success, I would see a solid blind draft that could be refined by research from the source material. In some examples, it is as simple checking how deeply involved I get. In others, it is as simple as seeing a trend in what information I can collect. It's a fair blend of passion and viability that determines where I get started with my videos.

		<h2>What is the production process like?</h2>
		<img>
		<p>Production is rather simple and fun. First I have to know if I have all the footage I need. If it is a video game, I set up OBS Studio and get it set up with a game off Steam, Epic Games, or Playstation Shareplay and make sure I can properly collect footage. Next I set up a folder structure similar to how the narrative for the game is set up; similar to a table of context for an IGN walkthrough. I then start recording gameplay and breaking up the recording sessions based on what works best for the game and file organization.
		<br>
		<br>
		While I am recording footage, I review my blind draft and make corrections to it as I go to best reflect the source material and my renewed thoughts about the game. This allows me to make sure that I am representing the media in question properly and refining my thoughts as I go. When I am done recording the gameplay or getting the video footage of the media in question, I then store them in a OneDrive account and an external SSD harddrive to ensure enough space on my system when I work later.
		<br>
		<br>
		The video backgrounds are a personal touch to add more personality to a video. I begin by simply sketching out what the general look of it is in my sketchbook with notes to the side of it for how to best translate that into production. The trick is to best represent the media in question while making it my own knowing it will be behind the actual visual focus of the video. The goal is to create something visually appealing but not distracting. This is done primairly in After Effects, Illustrator and Photoshop resectively. The exeption being the Alan Wake video where it is manipluated stock footage in Premiere Pro. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Audio voice overs was initally recorded in Audacity; but I have since moved onto Adobe Audition. I begin the voice over work only when the script is finalized and ready to go. Only extremely minor edits is made to the script at this point to ensure it reads naturally when spoken. The less I can make it sound like a college paper, the more successful the writing was. Once all the assets are collected, I move to editing.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>How does it all come together?</h2>
		<img>
		<p>When all the assets are together, I begin editing. When I edit, it is like soliving an open-ended puzzle. I know how it all should go together; however, I am the only one who knows how it would go togeher. Initally, when I was in highschool, I wanted to be a video editor and work with motion graphics and animation. When I get all the peices together and start editing, I always look back and ask questions. "Should this clip be here?" "Is this bit more for audio focus or is there a video clip I can use?" "What am I missing to make this what I know it could be?" These questions and many more directly influence my editing process because of my personal philosphy with design versus art. When I edit it is always trying to strike that balance of soliving a problem and self expression. </p>
