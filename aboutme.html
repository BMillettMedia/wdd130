    <h2>Bryan Millett</h2>
    <p>Hi, I am Bryan Millett and I am a software development major. When it comes to hobbies, I am an ameture content creator on Twitch.tv and YouTube while I look for employment. My current career is in graphic design; however, I hope to use this degree to pivot to fullstack web development and UI/UX Design. The thing I like most about BYUI is how affordable and flexible it is for the online work. I am a pretty busy guy so this is a huge advantage for me. I am pursuing my second BS degree. The advantages for learning web design is great simply because you see how websites are actually built and you can take those skills and move them into Wordpress and add a special personal touch to an otherwise basic templated website.</p>
